<h3>Get Going With Git and GitHub</h3>

<p>All of our repositories can be downloaded by opening the repository page
and clicking the download link found on the project page. If you want to report issues with a project,
contribute or simply stay up to date with repository changes we recommend
creating a GitHub account and cloning the repository instead. Below are a few resources to help you get started.</p>
